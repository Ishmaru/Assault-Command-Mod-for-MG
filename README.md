### Adds a new Techtree (Assault Command) & faction (Assault)

Assault Command is a fast paced RTS experience. With some unique features:

* No base building, you start with one pre-made base and must defend it at all cost. Defenses such as turrets can be built.
* Most infantry can perform "worker" commands such as building, repairing and harvesting. (Field Officers, and Kestrel are the exception).
* Standard Grunts are promoted to other classes.
* Transport Heli's can harvest over long distances.
* Mobile Base, Large transport truck, can deploy Grunts, and act as a drop off point for resources. 
* High variable damage. Units can do devastating damage or even miss entirely.
* Fast paced combat. New method to calculate damage gives better random calculations. Units can seem to be able to avoid damage.
* Unique special abilities, such as smoke grenades, EMP blasts, Decoy Tanks, Paradrop Infantry, Airlift Vehicles, and many more.
